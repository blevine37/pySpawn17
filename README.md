Features
========

This is an ab initio multiple spawning code written in python.  It is designed to be rather minimalistic, but easily extensible.  Right now, it has the following features:

-  Runs in the adiabatic representation with derivative couplings computed via NPI.
-  Interface to (a development version of) TeraChem via the tcpb interface. 
-  SSAIMS â€” Stochastic-Selection AIMS (optional per-run)
-  An analysis module for processing of simulation data.

This code is currently under development.  Example jobs are provided.  Documentation is present, but a work in progress.  DGAS is being implemented.  A release is forthcoming after these issues are addressed and the code is more rigorously tested.

Interfaces
==========

At present only an interface for (a development version of) TeraChem is provided, but pySpawn is designed to be readily interfaced with other codes.
