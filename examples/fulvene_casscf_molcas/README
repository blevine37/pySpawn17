To run PySpawn with OpenMolcas interface:

	- it is necessary to define two parameters in molcas_options in the submission script:

    	"python3" : "$HOME/Software/miniconda3/bin/python"    ## location of python 3
    	"project": 'ICX'				      ## variable definition for molcas job. scratch directory will be created as /tmp/ICX and input and output files will be named ICX.inp IXC.out etc. Each trajectory must have a different project name

- an INPORB file containing the initial RasOrb has to be in the parent folder where the submission script is run. This file MUST be called like that.

PySpawn will look for OpenMolcas installation under $MOLCAS, please define in your shell the path for the executable pymolcas accordingly.

the QM calculations will be run in a directory that will be automatically created and called QMDIR and deleted at the end of the simulation
